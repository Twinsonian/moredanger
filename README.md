# MoreDanger Mod for Luanti
Scaling difficulty mob mod for multiple Luanti games/mods. Based on the difficulty mobs will have faster movement speed, more damage and more health.

More Danger is a mob difficulty scaling mod that gives the player full control over how difficult mobs are in Luanti.

So far this provides support for Mineclonia(Game) and Mobs Redo (Mod) -- of course, don't run them together.

When in creative or if you have the right permission you can use /md to bring up the GUI to change difficulties.

You can also manually use commands:

/moredanger mode <normal|hard|nightmare|hell>
/moredanger_off
/moredanger_mode = tells you the current mode
/moredanger_debug = toggles debug mode on and off, this is mainly for viewing hps of mobs

The mod works different depending on which game or mode you are in. Mineclonia it basically gives mobs a second health bar that heals them in the background that gives the illusion of more hps. This is due to the way that Mineclonia clamps max hps. 

Mobs Redo requires that the mobs be set as the "monster" type.

Support for VoxelLibre and Mobkit are currently being worked on.
